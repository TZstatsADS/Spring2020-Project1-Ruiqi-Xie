### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2020

+ Projec title: Lyrics Exploratory Analysis
+ This project is conducted by [Ruiqi Xie]

+ Project summary: [a short summary] In my project, I first get the sentiments of each song and saw their trendence with time. Then I had a look at the word counts of songs in different years. And lastly I chose three genres to make the comparison of their emotion propotions. During this process, I also created an interative server with shinyapp to compare different genere in different years. Finally I clustered the genres into smaller groups to see which of them have something in common.
