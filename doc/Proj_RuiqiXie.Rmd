I use lyrics_processed as the data of my analysis."lyrics_processed" is a procesed corpus of 380,000+ song lyrics. 

Here, we explore these data sets and try to find interesting patterns.

### load all the required libraries

+ `tidyverse` is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures;
+ `tidytext` allows text mining using 'dplyr', 'ggplot2', and other tidy tools;
+ `plotly` allows plotting interactive graphs;
+ `DT` provides an R interface to the JavaScript library DataTables;
+ `tm` is a framework for text mining applications within R;
+ `scales` map data to aesthetics, and provide methods for automatically determining breaks and labels for axes and legends;
+ `data.table` is a package for fast aggregation of large data;
+ `wordcloud2` provides an HTML5 interface to wordcloud for data visualization;
+ `gridExtra` contains miscellaneous functions for "grid" graphics;
+ `ngram` is for constructing n-grams (“tokenizing”), as well as generating new text based on the n-gram structure of a given text input (“babbling”);
+ `Shiny` is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R;
+ `data.table` is a package for fast aggregation of large data;

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

This notebook was prepared with the following environmental settings.

```{r}
print(R.version)
```

### Load the processed lyrics data.
I use the processed lyrics data for analysis.

```{r, eval = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load lyrics data
#load('../output/lyrics_processed.RData')
#dt_processed<-dt_processed%>%drop_na()
```

### Data discriptions.

```{r}
#dim(dt_processed)
```

The data has 125704 rows and 7 columns

### Get the sentiment and number of lyrics of each song

```{r}
#below are processes I got data from lyrics
#emotions=get_nrc_sentiment(dt_processed$lyrics)
#word.count=word_count(dt_processed$lyrics)
#lyrics.list=cbind(dt_processed,emotions,word.count)
#save(lyrics.list, file="../output/lyrics_list.RData")

#for convenience, I just load the data
load("../output/lyrics_list.RData")
```

I first had a look at the trendence of all the motions along the years. 

```{r,fig.height=7, fig.width=7}
#summary the number of each sentiment in each year
lyrics.list.time.emotions<-lyrics.list%>%
  select(year,anger,anticipation,disgust,fear,joy,sadness,surprise,trust,negative,positive)%>%
  group_by(year)%>%
  summarise(anger=mean(anger),anticipation=mean(anticipation),
            disgust=mean(disgust),fear=mean(fear),
            joy=mean(joy),sadness=mean(sadness),surprise=mean(surprise),trust=mean(trust),
            negative=mean(negative),positive=mean(positive))
lyrics.list.time.emotions.ggplot<-lyrics.list.time.emotions%>%
  pivot_longer(2:11,names_to='emotion.type',values_to = 'emotion.count')

#plot
ggplot(lyrics.list.time.emotions.ggplot%>%filter(year>1995))+
  geom_line(aes(x=year,y=emotion.count,color=emotion.type))+
  scale_color_discrete("Average of emotions")+
  labs(x='Year',y='Number of emotions',title='Emotions in lyrics each year')+
  theme_light()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```


According to the plot, we can see that the sentiments of positive and negative are much high than all other emotions.

then I had a look at words count of lyrics along with the year 1996-2016

```{r,fig.height=8, fig.width=7}
lyrics.list.wordcount<-lyrics.list%>%
  select(year,word.count)%>%
  filter(year>=1996)%>%
  mutate(year.new=paste('year',year))%>%
  mutate(year.new=factor(year.new),
         year.reorder=reorder(year.new,year,mean,order=T))
#plot
beeswarm(word.count ~ year.reorder, 
         data = lyrics.list.wordcount,
         horizontal = TRUE, 
         pch = 16, col = alpha(brewer.pal(9, "Set1"), 0.6), 
         cex = 0.5, cex.axis = 0.8, cex.lab = 0.8,
         spacing = .5/nlevels(lyrics.list.wordcount$year.reorder),
         las = 2, xlab = "Number of words in a song.", ylab = "",
         main = "Songs in year 1996-2016")
```


we can see that in year 2006-2007, the songs are published more than other periods.

Then I had a look at sentiments' distributions in each genere

### I did a comparison using shinyapp, for simplier visualization, I first summarized the data

preparation for visualization
```{r}
lyrics.genre<-lyrics.list%>%
  select(genre,anger:positive)%>%
  group_by(genre)%>%
  summarise_if(is.numeric,mean)
lyrics.genre.simplified<-lyrics.genre%>%
  mutate(sum=anger+anticipation+disgust+fear+
           joy+sadness+surprise+trust+negative+positive)%>%
  arrange(desc(sum))
lyrics.genre.simplified
```

according to the table, I chose hip-hop, metal and folk three genres to show their sentiment distribution

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
genre_list<-c('Hip-Hop','Metal','Folk')
lyrics.genre.simplified<-lyrics.genre.simplified%>%
  filter(genre %in% genre_list)%>%
  select(1:11)
```

draw the rador plot with these three data

```{r,fig.height=8, fig.width=7}
min=min(lyrics.genre.simplified[2:11])
max=max(lyrics.genre.simplified[2:11])
plot_ly(
  type = 'scatterpolar',
  fill = 'toself'
  ) %>%
  add_trace(
  r = as.numeric(lyrics.genre.simplified[1,2:11]),
  theta=as.character(names(lyrics.genre.simplified[2:11])),
  name = as.character(lyrics.genre.simplified$genre[1])
  ) %>%
  add_trace(
  r = as.numeric(lyrics.genre.simplified[2,2:11]),
  theta=as.character(names(lyrics.genre.simplified[2:11])),
  name = as.character(lyrics.genre.simplified$genre[2])
  ) %>%
  add_trace(
  r = as.numeric(lyrics.genre.simplified[3,2:11]),
  theta=as.character(names(lyrics.genre.simplified[2:11])),
  name = as.character(lyrics.genre.simplified$genre[3])
  ) %>%
  layout(
    polar = list(
      radialaxis = list(
        visible = T,
        range = c(min,max)
      )
    )
  )

```

# cluster the generes
according to the numbers of all the generes, I explored whether I can cluster the generes into a larger group.

```{r,fig.height=8, fig.width=8}
heatmap.2(cor(lyrics.list%>%filter(genre=="Hip-Hop")%>%select(anger:trust)), 
          scale = "none", 
          col = bluered(100), , margin=c(4,4), key=F,
          trace = "none", density.info = "none")

par(mar=c(4, 6, 2, 1))
emo.means=colMeans(select(lyrics.list, anger:trust)>0.01)
col.use=c("red2", "darkgoldenrod1", 
            "chartreuse3", "blueviolet",
            "darkgoldenrod2", "dodgerblue3", 
            "darkgoldenrod1", "darkgoldenrod1")
barplot(emo.means[order(emo.means)], las=2, col=col.use[order(emo.means)], horiz=T, main="Hip Hop")
```


```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6}
lyrics.summary<-tbl_df(lyrics.list)%>%
  group_by(genre)%>%
  summarise_if(is.numeric,mean)%>%
  select(-2,-3)
lyrics.summary<-as.data.frame(lyrics.summary)
rownames(lyrics.summary)=as.character((lyrics.summary[,1]))
km.res=kmeans(lyrics.summary[,-1],iter.max=200,3)
fviz_cluster(km.res,
             stand=F,repel=TRUE,
             data=lyrics.summary[,-1],xlab='',xaxt='n',
             show.clust.cent = FALSE)+theme_light()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```


Conclusion: we can see the genres are divided into three parts according to the emotions. 
We can see from the plot that Hip-hop is a genre of its own. Rock, country, electronic and jazz have similar styles of expressing emotions.Folk and popular music fall into a broad category based on the mood they contain.
